# Engine AI | Full Stack Exercise

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When we run the dockers the database docker take sometime to start so check if is already ready to work

This project implements a full-stack web application for displaying securities and their historical data over time. It is part of the **Engine AI Full Stack Developer Exercise**. The backend is powered by **Node.js** with **TypeScript** and a **PostgreSQL database**, while the frontend uses **ReactJS**, styled with **Material UI**, and includes data visualizations using **Highcharts**.

## üìã Features

### Backend
- **Node.js/TypeScript** REST API or GraphQL:
  - **Security List Endpoint**: Fetches a list of securities with summary data.
  - **Security Detail Endpoint**: Fetches detailed information for a specific security, including daily time-series data.
- **PostgreSQL Database**:
  - Seeded with data from the provided `data.json` file that was created an python file to make a .sql that have all the INSERTS that is in the `data.json`.
  - Stores securities' metadata and their associated time-series data.

### Frontend
- **ReactJS Single Page Application**:
  - **Material UI** for styling.
  - **Highcharts** for interactive chart visualizations.
- **Screens**:
  1. **Security List**:
     - Displays a table with the following fields:
       - Symbol/Ticker
       - Name
       - Sector
       - Country
       - Trend
     - Background color for the **Trend** field:
       - **Red**: Trend value between -100 to -20.
       - **Green**: Trend value between -20 to 20.
       - **Blue**: Trend value between 20 to 100.
     - Clickable rows to navigate to the **Security Detail** screen.
  2. **Security Detail**:
     - Displays detailed information about a specific security:
       - Symbol
       - Name
       - Sector
       - Country
     - Includes a chart showing:
       - Close prices over time.
       - Volume over time.
